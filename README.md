# HashTagger-Twitter-Bot
A bot which retweets tweets of a particular given hashtag.

Any python app can be very easily deployed online through Herouku.

There are many tutorials and blog posts out there.
For convenience some of them are-
Procfile
It must be like work: python bot.py

requirements.txt

It is used to import and extra modules which we needed (here tweepy)

Note-
Instead of directly putting out your keys; you can also Config var using the Heroku Dashboard web UI.
I was having a bit trouble with that and since I have private repo; I am happy this way.(If you can help, leave a pull request).
